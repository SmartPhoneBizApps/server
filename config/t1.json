I was left with a urine infection for over a month without being told i had one ! I also had swollen glands asked for an emergancy appointment which i had to BEG for over the phone. One minute they have NO appointments then after begging for 10 minutes I got one (how does that make sense?), got one for 7am and when I got there on the date given with a text to prove it they sent me away saying I was not booked in. Every time there is an issue! even when I do get an appointment i have to wait over 1hour+ to be seen ! total waste of time ! they never send my prescriptions to the chemist on time ! I have been with them for 25 years and have dealt with health complications this past year which they DO NOT care about ! If you are registered here id say RUN now before you end up like me with random health complications which they WILL  NOT tend to! People only give 1+ stars on their reviews here because they obviously are normally healthy and have the one off appointment but I DO NOT RECCOMMED !!! This WAS my family doctor and ALL of my family members have left and I AM MOVING MY DOCTORS TO Chaplin Road GP (BEST IN WEMBLEY). I am also making an official complaint to CQC !!!!",

Everyone here was really good apart from disgusting behavior and appalling treatment from a member of reception. This receptionist is malicious and deliberately effecting my treatment I have complained and am still waiting to see what the outcome will be. I would have given the treatment I have received over the years a 5 star but as of the last few months it’s really become a stressful situation whenever I need to see a dr or get my medication this certain receptionist makes it nearly impossible. I don’t understand how a receptionist can have so much control over who or what a patient needs how is this even legal?\nPlease re-evaluate certain staff members as they’re driving this once recommendable practice into the ground and it’s sad to see",
