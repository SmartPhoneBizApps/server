The difference is: The visual “language” of these other disciplines is standardized using an internationally well-known semantic notation. Things that mean the same look the same, and if two things have a different meaning, they do not look the same.\n",

Imagine a customer orders an article on the Internet. Clicking the “Buy article” button triggers a lot of processes, and data is exchanged between different software systems so that the article is shipped, the seller’s catalog of goods is updated, and the correct amount is invoiced. If you want to implement such an application for your enterprise, you face the challenge of cross-linking a large number of different software systems and data sources. You also need to consider that the systems typically “speak” different connection protocols and store their data in different formats. SAP HANA Cloud Integration helps you to solve this challenge.",

However, this opens up questions on architectural best practices, integration options, security aspects, and how to operate the new environment.\n \nIn this course, you will get an overview of SAP’s cloud offerings and a deep dive into what hybrid means for integration, security, and operations, along with examples of SAP’s best practices and recommendations. We will also talk about transformation scenarios and the impact this has on your organization. Finally, we will provide some guidelines on how to start your own hybrid transformation journey. \n",

At its core, it is an innovative in-memory relational database management system that makes full sense of the capabilities of current hardware to increase application performance, to reduce cost of ownership, and to enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before.\nWith SAP HANA, you have the opportunity to build applications that integrate the business logic, control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented performance. As a developer, one of the key questions is how you can minimize data movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the CPUs, the better the application will perform.\nThis course will introduce you to native software development on SAP HANA. Registration, learning content, and the final exam are free of charge. However, to fully benefit from the course, you can access a fee-based system environment to develop your own code. ",
